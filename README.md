Much simpler and easy Rules Engine not only to use but also maintain 'Rules/Policy' for businesses

## 1. Introduction
This project is building a Rules(Policies)/Inference Engine with ease of use and maintain rules/policies. It aims to be:

* A rule author is allowed to write rules or policies in a plain text file for the engine rule parser
* A rule author or business persion does NOT need to implement the rules/policies separately like other rules engines
* A user of the engine can carry out Foward-chaining and Backward-chaining with a given rule/policy set

## 2. Roadmap
Add more features as follows;

* GUI for Rule IDE (it is just more than editor. working as an development IDE)
* workflow engine with GUI based diagram editor 
* Machine Learning type inference mechanism


## 3. Make your own Rules/Policies

## 4. How does it work
