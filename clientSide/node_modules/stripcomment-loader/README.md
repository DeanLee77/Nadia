# `stripcomments-loader` - A tiny loader to blanken your code.

While using UglifyJS over WebPack, I realized that the comments weren't stripped, actually. So I decided to write this loader that processes files and cleans them from comments - EXCEPT when debugging is enabled.

## Usage
It's recommended to use this as a `preLoaders` entry to process multiple files that use either `//` or `/* ... */` as comment indicators. Examples include JavaScript and CSS.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    entry: "./test.js",
    output: {
        path: __dirname,
        filename: "bundle.js"
    },
    module: {
        preLoaders: [
            {
                test: /\.(js|css)$/,
                loader: "stripcomments?-lines"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Now just require any JS or CSS file, and you should see comments getting stripped.

To retain comments, set `debug: true`. In this case, comments are kept in-place.

## Query options
You can control which and what is stripped:

    stripcomments?-block

This will **only** strip block comments. Adding `-line` will **only** strip line comments. Supplying both or none, then all will be stripped. Passing `+safe` will have extra effects on which comments are to be removed.
